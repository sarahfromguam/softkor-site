    <p>
      Jeff Ejan is the artist behind it all. A Guam native, he draws on
      his island upbringing, indigenous Filipino heritage, and mystical experiences
      in his art. His experience is extensive, ranging from his expressive, stylistic
      characters to his iconic murals to his one-of-a-kind paintings. His tattoos,
      which he creates under the alias of "stickybirtd", reflect his deep understanding
      of art across almost every medium out there. It comes as no surprise that he is commonly referred to as one of the best artists
      on island.
